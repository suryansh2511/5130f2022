We are trying to develop a Social Networking Web Application that deals with fake IDs and has all the features that a normal SOcial Networking appplication has. We aim to have login/logout, home page, friend list and more such modules in our project.

This idea was inspired from Mark Zukerberg who initially developed for university scale and so is what we are doing.
