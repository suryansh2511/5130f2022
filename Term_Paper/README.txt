The Web 2.0 phenomenon comprises a set of techniques and applications design principles for personalizing the web. It is different to classic web technologies as it refers to a class of web-based applications that have been recognized to share certain design patterns. Today, the term encompasses web-based applications like mashups, blogs, wikis, feeds, tagging systems, user-created publication systems, and social networking applications implemented by a range of techniques from programming languages to algorithms. The paper briefly describes some implementations of such new trends applied in science outreach, and information areas, which address different categories of users. The web-based feature of such applications imposes some constraints on the underlying network infrastructure, and inevitably creates security challenges.
